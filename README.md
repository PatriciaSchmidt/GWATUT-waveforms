# GWATUT Waveform Tutorial

Waveform models are a crucial input in gravitational-wave data analysis.
The models used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration as well as many 
external groups are publicly available via the LIGO Algorithms Library (LAL).

Here we have put together an interactive notebook that demonstrates the usage
of LAL (via Python) to generate waveforms from different models.

Simply launch the notebook via [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PatriciaSchmidt/GWATUT-waveforms/HEAD)
and have fun!
